#Introduction
This folder contains the code generated by openapi generator tool with typescript flag and the code of the cli created manually.
The file openapi.yaml was changed on all occurrence of format: uri because it caused an error during the generation (uri is a reserved word)

##What is changed after the generation of the code
1) moved the package.json from /src/generated to he root to manage also the dependencies of the cli;
2) moved the tsconfig.json, .gitignore and .openapi-generator-ignore;
3) replace all occurences "\models\" with "/models/" inserted into the generated files;
