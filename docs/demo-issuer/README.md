#Demo client issuer

##Purpose of this folder
This folder will contain the projects that will be the demo client for the issuer.

##Structure of the folder:
###ts-cli:
will contain the CLI created without any tool that actually can contact all APIs one to one and that have only a fix that should be corrected to be production ready: all commands launched using ctrl or cmd are inhibite by Inquirer there is a class (inquirer-config.ts") that should be fix it but it return an error.

###openapi-generator-ts
will contains a mix between the code generated by the command:
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g typescript -o src/generated
and the CLI created on ts-cli.
The file openapi.yaml is the same found on apps/io-func-sign-issuer with only a change, the URI format seems create some problems so the format was changed in string

##Final purpose of this folder:
Create a project that use a cli or/and web interface that can be given to the issuer to test or, why not, use directly to integrate with Firma con IO without any development
